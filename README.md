The software is experimental and *VERY* unstable at this time. System versions will be released alphabetically with ancient-greek inspired names. The first version will be called ["Antikythera"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism).

# User Personas

TODO: Matthew to work with designer on branding each persona and what tooling and resources entail. Current personas are:

- General*
- Gamer
- Engineer
- Clinician
- Creative

_*(prereq - must be installed for system or other personas to work - will be abstracted away from the users soon)_

_(ordered in terms of stability)_

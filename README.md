*Install desktop.yml (line-by-line) like so:*

```
wget https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/desktop.yml/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv desktop.yml-master desktop.yml
rm master.zip
cd desktop.yml
sudo ./assets/install.sh
```

Install personas like so:
```
ansible-playbook -K -l localhost everyday-user.yml # Recommended for everyone
ansible-playbook -K -l localhost programmer.yml
ansible-playbook -K -l localhost artist.yml
ansible-playbook -K -l localhost musician.yml
ansible-playbook -K -l localhost engineer.yml
ansible-playbook -K -l localhost gamer.yml
```

## Technical

_PRs are welcomed to further add to the personas or create new ones!_

#### Notes:

  - desktop.yml is powered by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) with [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/), [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt), [Pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package managers.

  - No software configurations are included in this solution - the idea is that everyone will have different configurations, especially in the programmer persona.

  - To add Snap, Pip, Apt, and Npm Global tasks, view programmer.yml to see example of all of these in use.

  - To add bash tasks, explore musician.yml for a program called Giada. Look at the bash declaration and the corresponding script file in `./assets/scripts/musician/giada.sh` - Notice how the script checks for its existance and writes the program to `/usr/local/bin/` if it doesn't exist. Note that all scripts should write to `/usr/local/bin`.

  - The Snap module for Ansible is not production-ready at the time of this writing. As a result, the `command` function is used in place of a formal task declaration due to the lack of this module integration.

  - Avoid adding ppas targeted for older Ubuntu release

#### Unsupported Systems:

The Following Ubuntu-based systems do not work correctly with this solution. Below is a list of the OSes and the issue:

- LUbuntu 18.04 - Didn't install typical packages that are supplied by Bionic
- Zorin OS 12.4 - The installer keep yielding `could not get lock`, despite a fresh install
- Linux Mint 19.1 - Apt was pointing at "Tessa" release as opposed to Bionic, which lead to packages not being found

#### TODOs:

- [ ] Consider ways to support systems that rely on Yum, Pacman, or RPM. May need to break personas up into folders to support this. Would require some duplication, however.

- [ ] Simplify install process

- [ ] Consider adding desktop entries + logos for /usr/local/bin programs

- [ ] Test on Elementary OS 5.0 Juno

- [ ] Add the following to programmer.yml: Latest Java JDK, Erlang, Elixir, Minikube, Dropbox, Swift, Wireshark

- [ ] Add the following to gamer.yml: n64 Emulator, 0.A.D (way too slow to download/install for some reason) 

- [ ] Add the following to artist.yml: Pencil Project

- [ ] Add current user to the docker group to avoid having to use `sudo` for all commands

- [ ] Fix `[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Instead of sudo/sudo_user, use become/become_user`

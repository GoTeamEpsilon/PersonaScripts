The software is experimental and *EXTREMELY* unstable/alpha at this time. System versions will be released alphabetically with ancient-greek inspired names. The first version will be called ["Antikythera"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism).

# User Personas

TODO: Matthew to work with designer on branding each persona in a layperson format. Information should include what tooling and resources come with each persona. Current personas are:

- General*
- Gamer
- Engineer
- Clinician
- Creative

_*(prereq - must be installed for System or other personas to work - will be abstracted away from the users soon)_

_(ordered in terms of stability)_

# Technical

## Install

TODO: Partner with a USB Linux distro company to make this painless.

1. Download Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic): https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/
2. Mount it on a USB stick for installation: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0
3. Plug flashdrive in and restart computer to bring up the setup wizard
4. Navigate through the setup wizard
5. Once the Ubuntu MATE is installed, open up the MATE terminal and run the following:

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/System.git
cd System/src
./main.sh
```

6. Run the "general" persona installer to set up the base system.

```
# cd ~/Desktop/System/src
cd persona_installers

./general.sh
```

7. Consider which personas you'd like to install and run the installers like so:

```
# cd ~/Desktop/System/src
cd persona_installers

./creative.sh

./clinician.sh

./engineer.sh

./gamer.sh
```
